Drawing with Code is an education station set up at the Carnegie Science Center. It is intended to expose participants to how to be creative with code. 
There are a bunch of fun examples to play with! There is everything from drawing with your nose to drawings that dance around when you scream at them.

You can download all these examples by pressing the "Download Zip" button on the right on this web page. You will also need Processing, which you can [download here](https://processing.org/download/). 

If you are just learning how to program, I strongly recommend checking out [Scratch!](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
